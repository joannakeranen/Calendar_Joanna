24.4.2024
WHAT I HAVE DONE:
- Adding holidays to the calendar
- Fixing reading and writing to an ics file
- Transferring the events file to another calendar
- Finishing adding events to the calendar (all day events, events that last multiple days)
- Error handling in the case of incorrect input

TESTING:
- Using the gui.

WHAT I WANT TO DISCUSS:
- Grading section in A+ says that the document should contain descriptive diagrams to describe the
structure of the program. Does this refer to the UML diagram? Or something else?
- How much should I write about algorithms?
- Does the project need to have tests? Is it enough to test the program using the gui and printing things?
- I thought that committing the code was only for the sprint meetings and I haven't committed my code
after all changes, but it is a grading criteria. What can I do at this point?

OTHER PROBLEMS:
- When adding an event that is over two days long the daily view shows the event at every time slot
instead of the all day section



14.4.2024

WHAT I HAVE DONE:
- View for adding an event and daily view
- Adding the correct dates, week and month to the gui
- Reading and writing to Categories file (text file), works
- Reading and writing to Events file (ics), does not work
- Getting Finnish holidays as an ics file from Google calendar (not used in my project yet)
- Creating a method to add events to the calendar (not complete yet)

TESTING:
- Creating simple tests for classes, that mainly print things to see it the methods are working correctly

WHAT I WANT TO DISCUSS:
- My method for writing to an ics file doesn't work and I can't figure out what is wrong with my code.

OTHER PROBLEMS:
- How can I add events to only one daily view, because the daily view, that can be accessed by
  clicking on the day that you want to view in detail, is the same view for each day?
- How can I add an event to a specific date because the dates are calculated based on the current day,
  each date is not specified in the gui?


27.3.2024
WHAT I HAVE DONE:
- Work on the GUI
- Switching between different views

TESTING:
- testing buttons by printing a text on click

WHAT I WANT TO DISCUSS:
- Can I have the date input as text (I need to learn about dateTime)

OTHER PROBLEMS:
- How can I make lines to the calendar?



7.3.2024
WHAT I HAVE DONE:
- Created my initial idea of the class structure
- Reading from EventExample file
- GridPane for the GUI

TESTING:
- Main.scala: Testing that the GridPane layout is correct with different backgound colors of sections
- Test for reading the example file

WHAT I WANT TO DISCUSS:
- How to test methods (for example how would I write a unit test for the method readFile or how can I print things in the method)?
- Where should classes and files be placed in the structure?
- What do I do with the information that I read from a file?
- How do I read different files (should the file name be given as a parameter)?

OTHER PROBLEMS:
- Main.scala: Cannot add padding and spacing to GridPane (maybe import something? compared to Lunchreview, same imports)
